Testing locally:
  Run chrome with: 
    open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security

  Then front end run: 
    npm run dev

  Then backend run:
    npm run start

In browser paste localhost link into two seperate tabs.

Plan to test with maybe a free tier of google cloud???

Something I hadn't really considered is with normal chess, checkmate is only a thing because people are taking turns.

In my version of chess there isn't really such thing as checkmate because no one is taking turns, instead the goal is about killing the other king. Now that I am thinking about it more a king getting put into check no longer matters either and so I think I am going to allow a player to put their king into check if they want.

Rules of Game:

  Normal chess rules with the following added:

    There are no turns, everyone may move as much as they want. 

    You win by killing the opponent king, not by putting your opponent into checkmate.

    When you move a piece that piece becomes locked for a certain amount of time proportional to the pieces value.

      Pawn: 2secs

      Knight and Bishop: 4secs

      Rook: 5secs

      Queen: 6secs

      King: 1 secs

    Thinking about adding the concept of health to pieces, not sure how to best implement that.
